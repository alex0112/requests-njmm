## This is a dead project.  I'm keeping the code here for my own personal use.

From openshift documentation: 
By adding `disable_asset_compilation` marker, you will disable asset compilation upon application deployment.
#####  NOTE:  THIS MARKER HAS BEEN SET!!!  ASSETS WILL NOT PRECOMPILE!  DON'T PRECOMPILE THEM, IT WILL TRIGGER A KNOWN BUG IN OPENSHIFT! ~Elder A. Larsen
