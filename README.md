## This is a discontinued project. 
From openshift documentation: 
By adding `disable_asset_compilation` marker, you will disable asset compilation upon application deployment.
#####  NOTE:  This marker has been set!!!  Assets will not precompile!  Don't precompile them, it will trigger a known bug in openshift! ~Elder A. Larsen
