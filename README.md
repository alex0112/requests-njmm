## This is a discontinued project. 
If you are a potential employer, or someone else who was referred here by me or by my portfolio I've left this project up as a demonstration of my knowledge in ruby, rails, and MVC in general.

This application when running, produced a page with a form that allowed an interested party to fill out their information and request literature of some sort.  Once the user clicked "submit" a text was automatically sent to a phone number stored in a database. 

#Project notes:
From openshift documentation: 
By adding `disable_asset_compilation` marker, you will disable asset compilation upon application deployment.
#####  NOTE:  This marker has been set!!!  Assets will not precompile!  Don't precompile them, it will trigger a known bug in openshift! ~Elder A. Larsen
